# ai-forum
A Tieba-inspired community forum built with AI-assisted capabilities. In v1, users can create and join “Bars” (吧) to organize topics and interests, publish posts, and interact through threaded replies. AI is used to improve discovery, moderation, and content quality (without replacing human community culture).
